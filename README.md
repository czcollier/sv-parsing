# parsing

Easy CSV parser builder.  Implements a simple DSL for creating arbitrary CSV parsers. See the [example code](https://github.com/SkyhookWireless/parsing/blob/master/examples/src/main/scala/com/skyhookwireless/parsing/) for more info.

Also take a look at the slides for [a planned talk justifying this approach to parsing](https://docs.google.com/a/skyhookwireless.com/presentation/d/1Z_rWolCFWFxXplgFwXmoheNwlTdXJOR3kFyRw4ecvz8/edit?usp=sharing)
